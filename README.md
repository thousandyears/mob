# Flash Mob Prototyping
_Towards the [Gardening](https://github.com/thousandyears/garden) of the futures worth wanting..._

Imagine a mob of people coalescing around an evolving vision by means of these few self-organising questions:

1. How can I help?
	- Kudos for helping to expand degrees of freedom for others.
	- Boundless responsibility/curiosity about the impact of one's contributions.
2. How can my contribution be known?
	- Feedback and traceability multiply the contribution's value.
	- Insights into the wider impact of a contribution are contributions in themselves.
3. How can I be known?
	- By centralised or decentralised (self-sovereign) identity.
	- Contributions are indelible, evidential and the contributor reserves the right to share them freely.
