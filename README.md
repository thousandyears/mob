# Flash Mob Prototyping
_Towards the [Gardening](https://github.com/thousandyears/garden) of the futures worth wanting..._

Imagine a mob of people coalescing around an evolving vision by means of these few self-organising questions:

1. **How can I help?**
	- Kudos for helping to expand degrees of freedom for others.
	- Boundless responsibility/curiosity about the impact of one's contributions.
2. **How can my contribution be known?**
	- Providing for analysis and feedback multiply the contribution's value.
	- Insights into the wider impact of a contribution are contributions in themselves.
3. **How can I be known?**
	- By centralised or decentralised (self-sovereign) identity.
	- Contributions are indelible, evidential and the contributor reserves the right to share them freely.

### Why "mobs"?
- Mobs are "people over process".
- Mobs do not ask for permission.
- Mobs must assume full responsibility over their actions (there's no-one else to).
- "Nobility" of the mob's vision cannot be inherited, assumed or otherwise be taken for granted.

### Why "flash mobs"?
- We're not there yet and the brief glimpses of how it could be is often as much as we can do right now.
- Bootstrapping is the only way.
- Self-evangelising.
- Bright flashes can leave long-lasting afterglow...
